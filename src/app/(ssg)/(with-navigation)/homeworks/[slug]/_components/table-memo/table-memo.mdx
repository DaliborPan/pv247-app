# Task 05 - Table, Memo, Dialog, Ref

This week, we will work with tables, dialogs, memoization, and references. Your task is to implement a user table using the pre-made components. The user can also add a new user to the table using a pre-made and functional form. As for the form, you must add a Dialog component from the `shadcn` library and implement a form confirmation button. The table must dynamically display the currently added user when adding a user. All buttons on the screen must be implemented using a single shared `components/button.tsx` button.

The user table is not very optimized, and you will encounter performance issues when typing text into a field in the form. Your task is to optimize this component using memoization. Finally, add the ability to sort by all columns, i.e., ID, name, and age.

All functionality is shown in the sample video.

## Requirements

- You're not allowed to change the `form-context` file.
- Install the dialog component from the `shadcn` library and use it to confirm the form submission. You don't need to do any extra styling on the form; the default look provided by Shadcn will do. I recommend adjusting the colors only.
- All buttons must be implemented using one shared `components/button.tsx` button.
- The table must be optimized using memoization.
- The table must be able to sort by all columns.
- The new user must be dynamically displayed in the table.

## Submission

There should be created a pull request called "Feedback" immediately after accepting the github classroom assignment.

**If you have a Feedback pull request**

You can push your solution straight to `main`. You will then see the diff against main in the pull request feedback. Once you have the solution in main, mark the Feedback PR as submitted.

**If you don't have a Feedback pull request**

It may be that it will be created later, or it may not be created at all... Therefore, as a precaution, create a new branch `solution` from main as soon as you accept the assignment, and then push your solution to it.

- If the Feedback PR does not appear, make a pull request from your `solution` branch to mainu and mark this PR as submitted.
- If the Feedback PR does appear, merge your branch `solution` into main, then mark the Feedback PR as submitted.
