# Task 06 - Forms, Async

This week, we'll look at forms and asynchronous operations, specifically getting and sending data to the API. You'll be given a project again, in which you'll have a freer hand this time. Create an application that will have a total of 4 pages. The routing is handled for you; focus on the page implementation.

We have prepared API endpoints and specifications for you. If you prefer to look directly at the code for these endpoints, you can find them in `src/app/api`.

<HomeworkGeneralInfo slug="forms-async" />

## Page Specifications

### Page `/`

No modifications are needed on this page. On this page you will find buttons to navigate to the rest of the application.

### Page `/profile`

This page will display content based on whether the user is logged in.

- The login form (username and password) will be displayed if the user is not logged in.

  - Use the `/api/login` endpoint to log in.
  - After a successful login, you need to save the user that was returned to you from the API to the application state so that it is available on other pages.
  - It is okay that after refreshing the page the user is logged out.

- If the user is logged in, information about the user is displayed, as well as the number of gifts that belong to the user.
  - The gift belongs to the user if `createdBy` is the user's `id`.
  - The number of gifts will only be displayed if logged in with the `user` role.

### Page `/list`

This page displays all gifts from the database. Based on who is logged in, the UI will be slightly different.

- Use the endpoint `/api/gift/list` to get all the gifts from the database.
  - If no one is logged in, only all gifts will be displayed without the possibility of any action.
- If a user with the role `santa` is logged in, each gift will have the option to mark the gift as `delivered`. To update the `delivered` status, use `PATCH /api/gift/:id`. If the gift is already in `delivered` status, it is possible to mark it as undelivered by setting `delivered: false`. Use the same endpoint.
- If the logged-in user is a `user` role, all gifts created by the logged-in user will be marked as belonging to the logged-in user in some way. At the same time, the user does not have the option to mark any gift as `delivered`.

### Page `/create`

This page allows users with the `user` role to create a new gift.

- If a user with the role `user` is logged in, the form for creating a gift is displayed, which contains 3 fields - `name`, `description` and `price`. A special validation of this form must take place, namely:
  - The `name` must be a string of at least 3 characters.
  - The `description` must be a string with a maximum length of 25 characters. It is also possible not to fill in description at all.
  - The `price` must be at most equal to the length of the `description` string. If description is not filled in, then the length of the `name` string.
- Use the endpoint `POST /api/gift` to create.

- If a user with the role `santa` is logged in, you will get a message that Santa cannot create gifts.

## Requirements

- To work with the API you need to use `tanstack-query`.
- To work with forms you must use `react-hook-form`.
- For data validation, use `zod`.

## Tips

- To edit the database directly, you can edit `gifts.json` and `users.json` directly.
- You should reate a Context to store logged in user. You can place `Context.Provider` inside `app/(app)/providers.tsx` file.
- You should edit pages, that are located in `/app/(app)/create/page.tsx`, `/app/(app)/list/page.tsx`, `/app/(app)/profile/page.tsx`.
- Separate the logic for query/mutation outside the components.
- Think of suitable folder structure for your application.

## APIs
